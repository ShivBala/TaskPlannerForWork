# V10 Filter Improvements - Stakeholder & Initiative Filters

## Overview
Added two new dropdown filters for **Stakeholder** and **Initiative** that work seamlessly with existing person, status, and date filters.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Filter State Variables
```javascript
let selectedStakeholderFilter = ''; // Track selected stakeholder filter
let selectedInitiativeFilter = ''; // Track selected initiative filter
```

### 2. New HTML Filter Dropdowns
Added two dropdown filters in the filter section:
- **ðŸ‘¥ Filter by stakeholder:** Dropdown with all stakeholders
- **ðŸ“Š Filter by initiative:** Dropdown with all initiatives

Both dropdowns include an "All" option to clear the filter.

### 3. Filter Functions

#### Stakeholder Filter
```javascript
function filterByStakeholder(stakeholder) {
    selectedStakeholderFilter = stakeholder;
    updateFilterUI();
    updateTable();
}

function populateStakeholderFilterDropdown() {
    // Populates dropdown with all stakeholders
    // Maintains selected value
}
```

#### Initiative Filter
```javascript
function filterByInitiative(initiative) {
    selectedInitiativeFilter = initiative;
    updateFilterUI();
    updateTable();
}

function populateInitiativeFilterDropdown() {
    // Populates dropdown with all initiatives
    // Maintains selected value
}
```

### 4. Updated Filter Logic
Enhanced `shouldShowTicket()` function to include new filters:
```javascript
// V10: Check stakeholder filter
const stakeholderFilterPassed = !selectedStakeholderFilter ||
    ticket.stakeholder === selectedStakeholderFilter;

// V10: Check initiative filter
const initiativeFilterPassed = !selectedInitiativeFilter ||
    ticket.initiative === selectedInitiativeFilter;

// All filters must pass
return personFilterPassed && statusFilterPassed && dateFilterPassed && 
       stakeholderFilterPassed && initiativeFilterPassed;
```

### 5. Enhanced Filter Status Display
Updated `updateFilterUI()` to show stakeholder and initiative filters in the status message:
```
Showing tasks assigned to: John and with status: In Progress and 
for stakeholder: Engineering and in initiative: Q4 Migration (5 tasks visible)
```

### 6. Smart Filter Management

#### Auto-Clear on Removal
- When a stakeholder is removed, if it was currently filtered, the filter is automatically cleared
- Same behavior for initiatives

#### Auto-Populate on Add/Remove
- Dropdowns are automatically updated when stakeholders/initiatives are added or removed
- Filter selection is preserved during updates

#### Integration with Existing Filters
- Works seamlessly with person, status, and date filters
- All filters work together using AND logic
- Filter count updates correctly to show visible task count

## User Experience

### Filter Selection
1. User selects a stakeholder from dropdown â†’ Table shows only tasks for that stakeholder
2. User selects an initiative from dropdown â†’ Table shows only tasks in that initiative
3. User can combine with other filters (person, status, date) for precise filtering

### Filter Clearing
- Select "All Stakeholders" to clear stakeholder filter
- Select "All Initiatives" to clear initiative filter
- Filters auto-clear if the filtered item is removed from the system

### Visual Feedback
- Filter status message shows all active filters
- Task count updates in real-time: `(5 tasks visible)`
- Dropdown selections persist across page operations

## Technical Benefits

1. **Smooth Performance**: Uses existing `scheduleRender()` for efficient table updates
2. **Type Safety**: Dropdown values match exact stakeholder/initiative names
3. **No Conflicts**: Works harmoniously with all existing filters
4. **Auto-Sync**: Dropdowns stay in sync with stakeholder/initiative lists
5. **Clean Code**: Follows existing filter pattern for consistency
