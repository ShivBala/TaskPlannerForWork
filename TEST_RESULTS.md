## Manual Testing Checklist

Please verify these items in the browser:

### No OT Checkbox Removal Tests

#### 1. Person Management UI
- [ ] Open the application in browser
- [ ] Navigate to "People Management" section
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Person cards do NOT show "No Overtime Allowed" checkbox
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Person cards show only: Name, Week availability inputs, Project Ready checkbox
- [ ] **Expected**: Clean UI without the confusing checkbox

#### 2. CSV Export/Import
- [ ] Click "Export to CSV" button
- [ ] Open exported CSV file
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Header has 10 columns (not 11): `Name,Week1,Week2,...,Week8,Project Ready`
- [ ] **VERIFY**: No "No OT" column in data
- [ ] Import the exported CSV back
- [ ] **VERIFY**: All data loads correctly
- [ ] **Expected**: Clean 10-column format

#### 3. Backward Compatibility (Old CSV)
- [ ] Locate an old CSV file with 11 columns (if available)
- [ ] Import the old CSV file
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Import succeeds (extra column ignored)
- [ ] **VERIFY**: All people and availability data loads correctly
- [ ] **Expected**: Graceful handling of old format

### Centralized Functions Tests

#### 4. Fixed-Length Task Week Calculation
- [ ] Add a new person (e.g., "Test User", 40h/week)
- [ ] Add a Fixed-Length task (e.g., Size M, 5 days)
- [ ] Set task to start on a Wednesday (e.g., Oct 22, 2025)
- [ ] Assign task to "Test User"
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Task end date is next Wednesday (Oct 29)
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Heat map shows task across correct weeks
- [ ] **Expected**: Correct week boundary calculations

#### 5. Flexible Task Week Calculation
- [ ] Change the task from Step 4 to Flexible (toggle off "Fixed-Length")
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Task adjusts to available capacity
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Heat map updates correctly
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Task stays within 100% capacity per week
- [ ] **Expected**: Flexible task adapts to capacity

#### 6. Week Modal Display
- [ ] With tasks from Steps 4-5 still present
- [ ] Click on a week cell in the heat map that contains tasks
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Modal opens showing task details
- [ ] **VERIFY**: All tasks in that week are listed
- [ ] Toggle task between Fixed/Flexible
- [ ] Click week cell again
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Modal updates with correct tasks
- [ ] **Expected**: Accurate task display in modal

### Heat Map Calculation Tests

#### 7. Capacity Allocation (Fixed Tasks)
- [ ] Create scenario: Person with 40h/week capacity
- [ ] Add Fixed-Length task requiring 60h in Week 1
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Heat map shows >100% utilization (e.g., 150%)
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Heat map displays in RED (overloaded)
- [ ] **Expected**: Fixed tasks show true capacity needs (can exceed 100%)

#### 8. Capacity Allocation (Flexible Tasks)
- [ ] Same person from Step 7
- [ ] Add Flexible task requiring 60h in Week 1
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Flexible task uses remaining capacity only
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Heat map ≤ 100% utilization
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Overflow spills to next week
- [ ] **Expected**: Flexible tasks adapt to available capacity

#### 9. Mixed Fixed + Flexible Tasks
- [ ] Same person, Week 1
- [ ] Add Fixed task: 30h
- [ ] Add Flexible task: 40h
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Fixed task allocated first (30h used)
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Flexible task uses remaining 10h in Week 1
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Flexible task spills 30h to Week 2
- [ ] **Expected**: Two-pass processing works correctly

### Console Log Tests

#### 10. Browser Console Verification
- [ ] Open browser Developer Tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
- [ ] Go to Console tab
- [ ] Refresh the page or add/modify a task
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Console shows "CAPACITY ALLOCATION WITH P1 PRIORITY" (not "NO OT")
- [ ] **VERIFY**: No errors in console
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Heat map calculation logs show 4 steps (not 5)
- [ ] **Expected**: Clean console output without No OT references
