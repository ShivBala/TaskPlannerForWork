**File:** `docs/acceptance-criteria/01-task-management.md`

**Covers:**
- Add new task with validations
- Remove task with cleanup
- Update assignments (single/multiple people)
- Update size, priority, start date, description
- Bulk operations (CSV import, multi-add)
- Duplicate detection
- Task validation rules
- Display and rendering

**Sample Scenarios:**
