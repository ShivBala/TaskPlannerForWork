## Summary

### Current State
- **Total Features:** 27 major functional areas
- **Tested Areas:** 7 (26%)
- **Test Count:** 25 tests
- **Critical Untested:** Task Management, Person Management, P1 Conflicts, Capacity Calculations

### Target State (4 Sprints)
- **Total Tests:** ~150 tests
- **Coverage:** 95%+
- **Confidence:** HIGH for production deployment

### Risk Assessment Without Additional Tests
- ❌ **HIGH RISK:** Core CRUD operations (add/remove/update) untested
- ❌ **HIGH RISK:** P1 conflict detection untested (business rule)
- ❌ **HIGH RISK:** Capacity overflow untested (core feature)
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK:** Import/export data integrity untested
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK:** Overdue task handling untested

### Recommended Action
**Proceed with Sprint 1 immediately** - Cover critical CRUD operations and P1 conflicts before any production usage.

## Testing Strategy Notes

### Current Strengths
1. ✅ Good integration test setup (iframe-based)
2. ✅ Helper methods for accessing let-scoped variables (eval approach)
3. ✅ State backup/restore for test isolation
4. ✅ Test framework with describe/it/assert

### Areas for Improvement
1. Add more granular unit tests for calculation functions
2. Add edge case tests (empty data, null values, invalid input)
3. Add performance tests for large datasets (100+ tasks, 20+ people)
4. Add browser compatibility tests
5. Add visual regression tests for UI components
6. Add accessibility tests (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
7. Add end-to-end user workflow tests

### Test Data Management
- Need test data factories for complex scenarios
- Need fixture data for consistent testing
- Need test data cleanup strategies
- Consider snapshot testing for complex outputs
