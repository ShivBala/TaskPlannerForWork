# Acceptance Criteria: Task Status Management

## Feature: Status Cycling (Click to Advance)

### Scenario 1: Cycle from To Do to In Progress
**Given** a task exists with status "To Do"  
**When** the user clicks on the status badge  
**Then** the task status should change to "In Progress"  
**And** the status badge should update to show "In Progress" with appropriate styling  
**And** the change should be saved to localStorage  
**And** the dirty state should be set

---

### Scenario 2: Cycle from In Progress to Done
**Given** a task exists with status "In Progress"  
**When** the user clicks on the status badge  
**Then** the task status should change to "Done"  
**And** the completedDate should be set to current date  
**And** the status badge should update to show "Done" with appropriate styling  
**And** the task should be excluded from capacity calculations  
**And** the change should be saved to localStorage

---

### Scenario 3: Cycle from Done to Paused
**Given** a task exists with status "Done"  
**When** the user clicks on the status badge  
**Then** the task status should change to "Paused"

**And** the change should be saved to localStorage

---

### Scenario 4: Cycle from Paused to To Do
**Given** a task exists with status "Paused"

**And** the task should be included in capacity calculations  
**And** the change should be saved to localStorage

---

### Scenario 5: Status cycle completes full loop
**Given** a task starts with status "To Do"  
**When** the user clicks the status badge 4 times

---

## Feature: Status Change History (Future Enhancement)

### Scenario 28: Track status change history

- reason: "Manual status change"

**And** statusHistory array should contain the change record

---

### Scenario 29: View status change history

---

## Feature: Bulk Status Updates

### Scenario 30: Mark multiple tasks as Done

**And** saved to localStorage

---

### Scenario 33: Handle invalid status value
**Given** a task has status: "InvalidStatus"
