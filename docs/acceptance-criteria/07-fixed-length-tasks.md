# Fixed-Length Tasks Feature - Acceptance Criteria

## Feature Overview
The Fixed-Length Tasks feature allows tasks to be either **Fixed-Length** (duration remains constant regardless of assignees) or **Flexible** (duration splits among assignees). This provides more accurate project planning when tasks require a fixed timeline.

## Core Behavior

### Fixed-Length Tasks (Default)
- **Duration**: Constant regardless of number of assignees
- **Capacity**: Each person contributes proportionally over the full duration
- **Example**: 10-day task with 2 people = each person works at 50% capacity for 10 days
- **Icon**: ðŸ”’

### Flexible Tasks (Opt-in)
- **Duration**: Splits among assignees
- **Capacity**: Each person works at 100% capacity for shorter time
- **Example**: 10-day task with 2 people = each person works at 100% for 5 days
- **Icon**: âš¡

## 1. Task Creation

### Scenario 1.1: Create Fixed-Length Task (Default)
**Given** I am creating a new task  
**When** I do not check the "Flexible Task" checkbox  
**Then** the task should be created with `isFixedLength = true`  
**And** the task should display the ðŸ”’ icon

### Scenario 1.2: Create Flexible Task
**Given** I am creating a new task  
**When** I check the "Flexible Task" checkbox  
**Then** the task should be created with `isFixedLength = false`  
**And** the task should display the âš¡ icon

### Scenario 1.3: Default Checkbox State
**Given** the task creation form is displayed  
**When** I view the "Flexible Task" checkbox  
**Then** it should be unchecked by default

### Scenario 1.4: Task Type Property Storage
**Given** I have created tasks of both types  
**When** the tasks are saved to localStorage  
**Then** each task should have the `isFixedLength` property correctly stored

### Scenario 1.5: Visual Indicators
**Given** I have tasks of both types in the list  
**When** I view the task list  
**Then** Fixed-Length tasks should show ðŸ”’  
**And** Flexible tasks should show âš¡

### Scenario 1.6: Backwards Compatibility
**Given** I have tasks created before this feature was added  
**When** the system loads these tasks  
**Then** they should be treated as Fixed-Length (isFixedLength = true)

## 2. End Date Calculations

### Scenario 2.1: Fixed-Length with 1 Person
**Given** a Fixed-Length task of size L (5 days)  
**And** 1 person assigned  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** the duration should be 5 business days

### Scenario 2.2: Fixed-Length with 2 People - Same Duration
**Given** a Fixed-Length task of size L (5 days)  
**And** 2 people assigned  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** the duration should still be 5 business days (not 2.5 days)

### Scenario 2.3: Fixed-Length with 5 People - Same Duration
**Given** a Fixed-Length task of size XL (10 days)  
**And** 5 people assigned  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** the duration should still be 10 business days (not 2 days)

### Scenario 2.4: Flexible with 1 Person - Baseline
**Given** a Flexible task of size L (5 days)  
**And** 1 person assigned  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** the duration should be 5 business days

### Scenario 2.5: Flexible with 2 People - Half Duration
**Given** a Flexible task of size XL (10 days)  
**And** 2 people assigned  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** the duration should be 5 business days (half of 10)

### Scenario 2.6: Flexible with 5 People - One-Fifth Duration
**Given** a Flexible task of size XXL (15 days)  
**And** 5 people assigned  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** the duration should be 3 business days (one-fifth of 15)

### Scenario 2.7: Task with No Assignees
**Given** a task of either type  
**And** no people assigned  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** the system should display "N/A" without crashing

### Scenario 2.8: Very Large Task Size
**Given** a task with size = 100 days  
**And** 1 person assigned  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** the system should calculate correctly without errors

### Scenario 2.9: Fixed vs Flexible Comparison
**Given** two identical tasks (same size, same assignees)  
**And** one is Fixed-Length, one is Flexible  
**When** end dates are calculated  
**Then** the Fixed task should have longer duration than the Flexible task

### Scenario 2.10: Weekend Boundaries
**Given** a Fixed-Length task starting on Friday  
**And** size = 5 days  
**When** the end date is calculated  
**Then** weekends should be skipped in the calculation

**Given** a Flexible task of 10 days (50 hours)  
**And** 2 people assigned  
**When** capacity is calculated  
**Then** each person should be allocated 100% capacity for 5 days

### Scenario 3.6: Mixed - Same Person with Fixed + Flexible
**Given** Alice is assigned to:
- Fixed task: 5 days, 2 people (50% capacity)
- Flexible task: 5 days, 1 person (100% capacity)
**When** capacity is calculated  
**Then** Alice should show 150% capacity (overallocated)  
**And** the heat map should highlight this in red

### Scenario 3.7: Mixed - Same Person with 2 Fixed Tasks
**Given** Alice is assigned to two Fixed tasks simultaneously  
**And** each is 5 days with 1 person (100% each)  
**When** capacity is calculated  
**Then** Alice should show 200% capacity (overallocated)

### Scenario 3.8: Mixed - Same Person with 2 Flexible Tasks
**Given** Alice is assigned to two Flexible tasks  
**And** both are 2 days, 1 person each  
**And** they start at different times  
**When** capacity is calculated  
**Then** capacities should be calculated for each task's duration

### Scenario 3.9: Overallocation Detection
**Given** a person assigned to multiple overlapping tasks  
**When** total capacity exceeds 100%  
**Then** the heat map should show >100% utilization in red

### Scenario 3.10: Underallocation Detection
**Given** a person assigned to a small task (1 day)  
**When** capacity is calculated  
**Then** the heat map should show <100% utilization in green

### Scenario 3.11: Zero Capacity Edge Case
**Given** a task with no assignees  
**When** capacity is calculated  
**Then** all people should show 0% utilization for that task

### Scenario 3.12: Rounding Precision
**Given** a Fixed task with 3 people (33.33% each)  
**When** capacity is calculated  
**Then** percentages should be rounded appropriately without errors

### Scenario 3.13: Heat Map Structure for Fixed Tasks
**Given** Fixed-Length tasks exist  
**When** the heat map is generated  
**Then** it should have the correct array structure with weeks and utilization data

### Scenario 3.14: Heat Map Structure for Flexible Tasks
**Given** Flexible tasks exist  
**When** the heat map is generated  
**Then** it should have the correct array structure with weeks and utilization data

### Scenario 3.15: Heat Map Structure for Mixed Tasks
**Given** both Fixed and Flexible tasks exist  
**When** the heat map is generated  
**Then** it should correctly combine capacities from both types

## 6. Edge Cases and Validation

### Scenario 6.1: Task with No Assignees
**Given** a task with no people assigned  
**When** calculations are performed  
**Then** the system should not crash  
**And** should show "N/A" for end date

### Scenario 6.2: Task with 1 Assignee (Fixed = Flexible)
**Given** a task with only 1 person assigned  
**When** comparing Fixed and Flexible behavior  
**Then** both should behave identically (same duration and capacity)

### Scenario 6.3: Very Small Task Size (0.5 days)
**Given** a task with size = 0.5 days  
**When** calculations are performed  
**Then** the system should handle fractional days correctly

### Scenario 6.4: Very Large Task Size (100 days)
**Given** a task with size = 100 days  
**When** calculations are performed  
**Then** the system should not break or cause performance issues

### Scenario 6.5: Changing Task Type After Creation
**Given** an existing Fixed task  
**When** I change it to Flexible (or vice versa)  
**Then** the task should be updated correctly  
**And** recalculations should reflect the new type

### Scenario 6.6: Deleting Task with Specific Type
**Given** tasks of both types exist  
**When** I delete a Fixed task  
**Then** it should be removed successfully  
**And** Flexible tasks should remain unaffected

### Scenario 6.7: Status Changes Don't Affect Task Type
**Given** a Fixed task with status "To Do"  
**When** I change the status to "In Progress"  
**Then** the task should remain Fixed-Length  
**And** isFixedLength should not change

### Scenario 6.8: Filtering Works with Both Types
**Given** I have tasks of both types assigned to different people  
**When** I filter by person  
**Then** the filter should work regardless of task type  
**And** both Fixed and Flexible tasks should be included in results
