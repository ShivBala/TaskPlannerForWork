# 🚀 No Overtime + P1 Priority Weighting Feature

## 📋 Feature Branch
**Branch:** `feature/no-overtime-p1-priority-weighting`
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1-3 Complete (HTML Implementation)
**GitHub:** https://github.com/ShivBala/TaskPlannerForWork/tree/feature/no-overtime-p1-priority-weighting

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

This feature implements **realistic capacity-based scheduling** with two key constraints:

### 1. **No Overtime (No OT) Constraint** 🚫
- **Purpose**: Cap a person's weekly capacity at 100%
- **Default**: Enabled (ON) for all people
- **Behavior**: 
  - When enabled: Person cannot exceed 100% capacity
  - Tasks automatically extend to future weeks
  - Allocations scaled proportionally to fit within capacity
- **Control**: Per-person checkbox in UI

### 2. **P1 Priority Weighting** 🎯
- **Purpose**: Ensure critical (P1) tasks get appropriate focus
- **Rule**: P1 tasks consume **80% of weekly capacity**
- **Behavior**:
  - Multiple P1 tasks split the 80% equally
  - P2-P5 tasks share remaining 20%
  - When no P1 tasks: others get 100% capacity
- **Automatic**: Based on task priority (no configuration needed)

---

## ✅ Completed Implementation (Phases 1-3)

### **Phase 1: Data Model** ✅
- Added `noOvertime` field to person object (default: `true`)
- Updated CSV export/import with "No OT" column
- Backwards compatible with old CSV format
- Initialize new people with `noOvertime=true`

**Files Modified:**
- `html_console_v10.html` - CSV import/export functions
- Person object structure

**Commits:**
- `52f1335` - Phase 1: Add No Overtime data model and UI

### **Phase 2 & 3: Core Algorithm** ✅
- Complete rewrite of `calculateWorkloadHeatMap()` function
- Chronological task processing (by start date)
- Capacity tracking per person per week
- Remaining effort tracking per task-person pair
- P1 priority weighting (80/20 split)
- No OT constraint enforcement
- Detailed console logging for debugging

**Algorithm Flow:**
```
1. Initialize Trackers
   - capacityTracker: {personName: {weekIndex: {used, allocations, p1Hours, otherHours}}}
   - taskRemainingEffort: {taskId: {personName: hoursRemaining}}

2. For Each Week (0-7):
   For Each Person:
     a. Find active tasks with remaining effort
     b. Group by priority (P1 vs Other)
     
     c. Calculate capacity split:
        - If P1 tasks exist:
          * P1 Capacity = 80% of weekly capacity
          * Other Capacity = 20% of weekly capacity
        - If no P1 tasks:
          * Other Capacity = 100% of weekly capacity
     
     d. Allocate to P1 tasks:
        - Split P1 capacity equally among P1 tasks
        - Min(effort remaining, allocated capacity)
        - Track p1Hours separately
     
     e. Allocate to Other tasks:
        - Split Other capacity proportionally by effort needed
        - Track otherHours separately
     
     f. Apply No OT Constraint (if enabled):
        - If total > capacity:
          * Scale all allocations proportionally
          * Return unused effort to taskRemainingEffort
          * Cap total at capacity

3. Build Heat Map Data:
   - Include taskBreakdown, p1Hours, otherHours
   - Calculate utilization percentage
   - Determine color class (green/yellow/red)
```

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Heat map cells show P1 allocation percentage badge
- Enhanced tooltips with P1/Other breakdown
- Color-coded utilization:
  - 🟢 Green: 0-60% (Available)
  - 🟡 Yellow: 61-90% (Busy)
  - 🔴 Red: 91%+ (Overloaded)

**Files Modified:**
- `html_console_v10.html` - calculateWorkloadHeatMap(), renderWorkloadHeatMap()

**Commits:**
- `1144ebb` - Phase 2 & 3: Implement P1 priority weighting + No OT core algorithm

## 📊 Calculation Examples

### **Example 1: Single P1 Task + No OT Enabled**
```
Person: Vipul, 25h/week capacity, No OT = Yes

Tasks:
- P1 Task A: 40h total effort
- P2 Task B: 20h total effort

Week 1:
  P1 Capacity: 20h (80%)
  Other Capacity: 5h (20%)
  
  Allocations:
  - P1 Task A: 20h → Remaining: 20h
  - P2 Task B: 5h → Remaining: 15h
  - Total: 25h (100%) ✓

Week 2:
  P1 Capacity: 20h (80%)
  Other Capacity: 5h (20%)
  
  Allocations:
  - P1 Task A: 20h → Remaining: 0h ✅ COMPLETE
  - P2 Task B: 5h → Remaining: 10h
  - Total: 25h (100%) ✓

Week 3:
  No P1 tasks active
  Other Capacity: 25h (100%)
  
  Allocations:
  - P2 Task B: 10h → Remaining: 0h ✅ COMPLETE
  - Total: 10h (40%)

Result:
- P1 Task A: Completes in 2 weeks (20h/week)
- P2 Task B: Extends to 3 weeks (5h/week while P1 active, then 10h/week)
```

### **Example 2: Multiple P1 Tasks**
```
Person: Sameet, 25h/week capacity, No OT = Yes

Tasks:
- P1 Task A: 30h effort
- P1 Task B: 30h effort
- P2 Task C: 20h effort

Week 1:
  P1 Capacity: 20h (80%) → Split between 2 P1 tasks = 10h each
  Other Capacity: 5h (20%)
  
  Allocations:
  - P1 Task A: 10h (40%) → Remaining: 20h
  - P1 Task B: 10h (40%) → Remaining: 20h
  - P2 Task C: 5h (20%) → Remaining: 15h
  - Total: 25h (100%) ✓

Week 2-3: Same pattern

Week 4:
  P1 Task A completes (30h over 3 weeks)
  P1 Capacity: 20h (80%) → Only Task B
  Other Capacity: 5h (20%)
  
  Allocations:
  - P1 Task B: 20h (80%) → Remaining: 10h
  - P2 Task C: 5h (20%) → Remaining: 10h
  - Total: 25h (100%) ✓
```

### **Example 3: No OT Disabled**
```
Person: Peter, 25h/week capacity, No OT = No (disabled)

Tasks:
- P1 Task A: 40h effort
- P2 Task B: 30h effort

Week 1:
  P1 Capacity: 20h (80%)
  Other Capacity: 5h (20%)
  
  Allocations:
  - P1 Task A: 20h
  - P2 Task B: 30h (wants all 30h in week 1)
  - Total: 50h (200%) ⚠️ ALLOWED (No OT disabled)
  
Result:
- Shows 200% utilization (RED)
- Both tasks complete faster
- Indicates unrealistic scheduling

## 🔧 Testing Recommendations

### **Test Case 1: No OT Enabled (Default)**
1. Create person with 25h/week capacity, No OT = Yes
2. Add P1 task (40h effort)
3. Add P2 task (20h effort)
4. **Verify**: 
   - Week 1: 100% utilization (20h P1 + 5h P2)
   - Week 2: 100% utilization (20h P1 + 5h P2)
   - Week 3: 40% utilization (10h P2)

### **Test Case 2: No OT Disabled**
1. Create person with 25h/week capacity, No OT = No
2. Add P1 task (40h effort)
3. Add P2 task (30h effort)
4. **Verify**:
   - Week 1: 200% utilization (50h total) - RED
   - Shows overload warning

### **Test Case 3: Multiple P1 Tasks**
1. Create person with 25h/week capacity, No OT = Yes
2. Add P1 Task A (30h effort)
3. Add P1 Task B (30h effort)
4. Add P2 Task C (20h effort)
5. **Verify**:
   - Each P1 task gets 10h/week (40% each)
   - P2 task gets 5h/week (20%)
   - Total: 25h/week (100%)

### **Test Case 4: No P1 Tasks**
1. Create person with 25h/week capacity
2. Add P2 task (25h effort)
3. Add P3 task (25h effort)
4. **Verify**:
   - Both tasks share 25h proportionally
   - No 80/20 split (100% available for non-P1)

### **Test Case 5: Real-Time Updates**
1. Create tasks with P2 priority
2. **Change one to P1** → Verify immediate recalculation
3. **Toggle No OT checkbox** → Verify heat map updates
4. **Change availability** → Verify allocations adjust
